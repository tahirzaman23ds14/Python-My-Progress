#In Python,
#comments are notes in your code that the computer ignores.
#They are just for humans to understand the code better.

# There are two types of comments in Python:

#1.  Single-line comment
#    Use the # symbol.
#    Everything after # on that line is ignored by Python.

#    Example
        #This is a single-line comment
#        print("Hello, World!")  # This prints Hello, World!

"""
2. Multi-line comment (docstring style)

Python does not have a special multi-line comment symbol.
Instead, programmers use triple quotes 
"""

# OUt side of text  having triple quotes up and down 

"""
   Example of 
   multi line comment

#  This is a multi-line comment.
# You can write as many lines as you want.
# Python will ignore this.

#⚡ Tip:

#
# Use comments to explain why you wrote code, not what (because code itself shows what it’s doing).
