############################################## What iS Data Types?

"""
In Python, a data type defines the kind of data a variable can store.
It tells Python whether the value is a number, text, True/False, or a collection.
"""


############################################  DATA TYPE BEHIND THE SEENS

"""
Behind the scenes, Python stores every value as an object, and each object has a specific data type (class).
This type information tells Python how much memory to use, how to represent the value, and what operations are allowed on it.

""" 

############################################## WHY PYTHON NEEDS DATA TYPES?

"""
Python needs data types to:

Identify the kind of data (number, text, True/False, etc.).

Decide memory size required to store the value.

Define valid operations (you can add numbers but not number + text).

Ensure correctness in calculations and logic.

ðŸ‘‰ Without data types, Python wouldnâ€™t know how to handle values properly. 

"""

############################################  DATA TYPES CATEGORIES
"""
In Python, data types are divided into categories:

Numeric Types â†’ int, float, complex

Text Type â†’ str

Boolean Type â†’ bool

Sequence Types â†’ list, tuple, range

Set Types â†’ set, frozenset

Mapping Type â†’ dict

None Type â†’ NoneType

################################## PRACTICE THE DATA TYPES

# Numeric
a = 10        # int
b = 3.14      # float
c = 2 + 3j    # complex

# Text
d = "Hello"   # str

# Boolean
e = True      # bool

# Sequence
f = [1, 2, 3]          # list
g = (4, 5, 6)          # tuple
h = range(5)           # range

# Set
i = {1, 2, 3}          # set
j = frozenset({4, 5})  # frozenset

# Mapping
k = {"name": "Tahir", "age": 20}  # dict

# None
l = None               # NoneType

# Checking data types
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
print(type(f))
print(type(k))
print(type(l))
