# what is variable?


# how varibale works



# practice with variable


print("My name is Tahir")
print("Tahir is learning Python")
print("Tahir want to become a Python Expert")

    # if i Replace Tahir with some other name
    # thats a lot of work
    # instead we can use variable

###### Let's use variables to make our code more efficient and easier to maintain.

name = "Ali"  # Assigning the "Ali"  to the variable 'name' # or you can use any name instead of Ali

print("My name is", name)  # Using the variable 'name' in the print statement
print(name, "is learning Python")  # Using the variable 'name' in the print statement
print(name, "want to become a Python Expert")  # Using the variable 'name' in the print statement
